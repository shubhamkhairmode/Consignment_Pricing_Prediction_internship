# Consignment Pricing Prediction internship Project
## Problem Statement :
The market for logistics analytics is expected to develop at a CAGR of 17.3 percent
from 2019 to 2024, more than doubling in size. This data demonstrates how logistics
organizations are understanding the advantages of being able to predict what will
happen in the future with a decent degree of certainty. Logistics leaders may use this
data to address supply chain difficulties, cut costs, and enhance service levels all at the
same time.

The main goal is to predict the consignment pricing based on the available factors in the
dataset.
In this project, our goal is to predict the mode of transport for a given shipment using supply chain data. To accomplish this, we will harness the power of TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing a neural network model.

By analyzing various factors and features within the supply chain data, we aim to develop a reliable model that can accurately predict the appropriate mode of transport for shipments. This predictive capability can assist in optimizing logistics and decision-making processes within the supply chain industry.

With the TensorFlow/Keras framework, we will construct and train a neural network that learns from the provided data to make predictions. By leveraging advanced techniques such as dense layers and softmax activation, our model will be able to classify and predict the most suitable mode of transport for a given shipment scenario.

Through this project, we aim to enhance supply chain management by enabling efficient and accurate decision-making in the shipment transportation process. Let's dive into the world of supply chain data and embark on this exciting journey of prediction and optimization!
